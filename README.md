# DataVisualizationCharts
This repository contains Python scripts for generating visualizations from an Excel dataset named `balance_data.xlsx`. The scripts utilize the pandas and matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

## Scripts

1. **pie_chart_code.py**: This script generates a pie chart illustrating the distribution of activities recorded in the dataset. It reads the Excel file, filters out activities with low occurrences, and plots the pie chart accordingly. The resulting chart is saved as `activity_pie_chart.png`.

2. **chart_Percentage_of_Nature_of_Injury_over_the_Years.py**: This script generates a chart showcasing the percentage of nature of injuries over the years. The specific implementation details are not provided in this README, but you can refer to the script for further information.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the desired script(s) using Python.

## Data

The provided dataset (`balance_data.xlsx`) contains a sample of 1000 rows of data. Please note that this is a small subset of the actual dataset, and the visualizations may not fully represent the entire dataset.
